                    <div class="text-justify">Before fully forming our idea, we strove to understand the complexity of algal
                        blooms and their effects around Tompkins County. Speaking with local business owners, legislators, and
                        field experts, <b>we realized that blooms affect a large subset of people in our community.</b> Using
                        personal accounts and expertise, we were able to narrow down our project to two main parts that would
                        effectively address algal blooms in the Finger Lakes: detection and remediation.
                        <br><br> While we were excited to undertake this task, we first needed to determine the direction we
                        wanted to take our idea. We spoke with <b>professional experts</b> and <b>community members</b> to pinpoint
                        our approach to detection, incorporating their thoughts to create an innovative method to quantify microcystin
                        toxicity. As we finalized our detection system, we started pursuing an effective remediation process.
                        Using the feedback of <b>legislators</b> and <b>researchers</b>, we designed our degradation system to
                        expand current legislative initiatives that address HABs. Throughout the entire process, our project
                        integrated diverse perspectives to fabricate a comprehensive solution with people and the environment
                        at its core. Here, we highlight the most impactful interviews that we conducted and how our conversations
                        shaped the course of our project from napkin to prototype.

                                                <h3>Noah Mark</h3>
                                                <p class="text-justify">As part of a preliminary exploration into our project
                                                    this year, we met with intern Noah Mark at the Community Science Institute
                                                    (CSI). The CSI is a nonprofit organization in the Ithaca area that is state-certified
                                                    to monitor water quality. Noah Mark works on monitoring and testing water
                                                    collected at different sites on Cayuga Lake. We spoke with him to learn more
                                                    about the prevalence of harmful algal blooms in the Finger Lakes and what
                                                    methods are currently being used to test their toxicity. He and his colleagues
                                                    told us about ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), the method they
                                                    currently use to test blooms on Cayuga Lake. An important takeaway from our
                                                    meeting was that determining the toxicity of cyanobacterial blooms is both
                                                    costly and time-consuming. Noah also suggested focusing on water treatment
                                                    or toxin breakdown, rather than just algae clean-up. Meeting with Noah helped
                                                    us assess which direction we wanted to pursue our project.

                                                <h3>Dr. Nelson Hairston</h3>
                                                <p class="text-justify">Dr. Nelson Hairston is a professor at Cornell University
                                                    researching freshwater organisms and their ecological and evolutionary response
                                                    to environmental change. We conducted an interview with him to learn more
                                                    about the causes and formation of algal blooms. He told us that a major part
                                                    of formation is phosphorus, which comes from runoff and legacy sediment.
                                                    Additionally, there is the phenomenon of thermal stratification, which leads
                                                    to the build-up of phosphorus at the bottom of a lake. Professor Hairston
                                                    went on to explain that continuous stratification mixes phosphorus into the
                                                    rest of the lake, so it is more common for shallow lakes to have more blooms.
                                                    Consequently, this is why the Finger Lakes region is more subject to HABs
                                                    occurring. Our meeting with Professor Hairston gave us insight on bloom occurrence
                                                    and build-up, and thus, we developed a stronger understanding as to why our
                                                    region is especially affected. </p>

                                                    Manager to discuss his experience with algal blooms as someone who frequents
                                                    the lake. Conversing with him helped us gain perspective from someone who
                                                    may not know all of the science behind harmful algal blooms (HABs) but has
                                                    been affected by them. Pat told us that algal blooms impact people’s ability
                                                    to go into the water because the wait time between sampling the water and
                                                    obtaining positive lab results prevents water access until the bloom clears
                                                    up. In addition, there are health risks involved in being near contaminated
                                                    water. For example, humans may have adverse reactions by coming into contact
                                                    with the toxins produced by blooms. His comments inspired us to look further
                                                    into an effective detection and treatment method that would allow for faster
                                                    turnaround than existing methods. <br><br> When we asked him about the possibility
                                                    of building a boat to collect water samples, he advised us to consider the
                                                    size and mobility of our vehicle when navigating “nooks and crannies” on
                                                    a lake (e.g. a dock). His suggestion was later incorporated when we determined
                                                    the dimensions and materials of our boat.

                                            only be aware of the subject matter of our project but properly informed as well.
                                            As such, we decided to create an informational packet that would educate people about
                                            algal blooms. To do this, we first needed to scope out what information people already
                                            knew about harmful algal blooms, so we created a survey to help us understand the
                                            extent of their knowledge. We visited and spoke with community members at Ithaca
                                            Farmers’ Market, Ithaca Commons, and Cornell Campus, and in the end, collected over
                                            50 responses. The charts below show the results of our survey.

                                            The key takeaways from these responses are as follows:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>While a larger section of people (55%) answered that they either never or
                                                    rarely noticed algal blooms in their local area, there was still a significant
                                                    portion (27.5%) of people that did not know what algal blooms look like.</li>
                                                <li>Most people (60.8%) think it would be very or extremely difficult to distinguish
                                                    between a harmful algal bloom and non-toxic algal bloom.</li>
                                                <li>70.6% of people think HABs have an extreme or significant impact on local
                                                    ecosystems, but only 17.7% think that HABs have the same impact on their
                                                    own daily lives.</li>
                                                <li>74.5% of people would be comfortable seeing an automated boat collecting
                                                    water samples from local lakes.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            Using these conclusions, we created an informational booklet to serve as an introduction to HABs, including information on
                                            what they are and how they affect the environment. We discuss this booklet in further
                                            detail on our Collaborations page, where we have also included a PDF of the final
                                            version. <br><br>Note: iGEM requires any form of human research to comply with established
                                            ethical standards, hence we consulted the website for Cornell’s Institutional Review
                                            Board. The website included a Decision Tree for determining whether organizations
                                            need to submit an application to the IRB prior to carrying out their research. Since
                                            our research primarily involved anonymous community surveys to gauge the public’s
                                            opinion and knowledge of harmful algal blooms, it was determined that it was not
                                            necessary to submit an application to the IRB.

                                                <h3>Shady Amin</h3>
                                                <p class="text-justify">The interview with Shady Amin was conducted over Skype.
                                                    One of the major talking points of the interview was the formation of harmful
                                                    algal blooms (HABs). Generally speaking, it is known that having more nutrients
                                                    in the water, specifically nitrogen and phosphorus, increases the likelihood
                                                    that algal blooms will form. What is unknown, however, is how microcystins
                                                    are formed. Professor Amin theorized that there must be some type of cell-to-cell
                                                    communication between the cyanobacteria that stimulates the growth and formation
                                                    of microcystin-forming bacteria. Professor Amin also mentioned that two of
                                                    the major methods of testing for microcystins are HPLC and ELISA. ELISA is
                                                    a much quicker process than HPLC and has very high throughput. A test using
                                                    ELISA only takes about 2 hours. ELISA, however, is much less accurate and
                                                    worse at determining the concentration of toxins compared to HPLC. HPLC takes
                                                    a much longer time and is very expensive but is extremely accurate and provides
                                                    information on the concentration of microcystins in the water. From our conversation
                                                    with Professor Amin, we noted the importance of finding a solution that is
                                                    more efficient and effective than current methods of detection.

                                                <p class="text-justify">Julie Lockhart is a volunteer at CSI that works especially
                                                    with algal blooms. She helps collect samples from the finger lakes region
                                                    for CSI to analyze. Julie shared with us a lot of personal experiences with
                                                    algal blooms and how it has been difficult to control and identify where
                                                    the algal blooms would grow and which ones were harmful. One of the major
                                                    complaints Julie had was the identification of HABs from normal algal blooms.
                                                    When she collected a sample of algal bloom, CSI would obtain the sample but
                                                    would have to send them off in order to test them for analysis. The method
                                                    used is usually an ELISA which should not take a very long time to run an
                                                    assay. The results she would receive, however, would take about 3 weeks to
                                                    come in. At that point, the algal bloom is already cleared and the data is
                                                    practically useless. This allowed us to see the need and importance for an
                                                    instantaneous detection method, especially for differentiating between HABs
                                                    and normal algal blooms.</p>

                                                    lie in Meteorology. In the event <i>Nutrients in the Watershed, Unusual Weather,
                                                        and Harmful Algal Blooms: A Public Conversation</i>, he focused on the
                                                    differences between climate and weather. He discussed the climate around
                                                    Cayuga Lake and how it has changed over time. One of the major points Mark
                                                    Wysocki talked about is how the changing climate contributed to earlier bloom
                                                    seasons, longer bloom seasons, and a higher possibility of runoff to occur.
                                                    With the rise in fluctuations in climate, nutrients also begin to fluctatte
                                                    creating unpredictable patterns in things like algal blooms. In conclusion,
                                                    Mark Wysocki analyzed the relationship between climate change in the Cayuga
                                                    region and the rise in algal bloom appearances.

                                                    in the Cayuga Lake Watershed” and discussed some of the volunteer monitoring
                                                    partnerships that help oversee the Cayuga Watershed. Three to four times

                                                    chloride, and mineral parameters. This volunteer system is very low-cost
                                                    and overall works better than a consulting firm. However, the resolution

                                                <h3>David Erickson</h3>
                                                <p class="text-justify">Professor David Erickson’s area of expertise is in microfluidics
                                                    and point-of-care diagnostics. When we initially reached out to Professor
                                                    Erickson, we had been considering the use of microfluidics in our project
                                                    to detect microcystins. However, our team was not very familiar with how
                                                    microfluidics might fit into the scope of our project, so we sought Professor
                                                    Erickson’s advice on which areas we should pay special attention to when
                                                    designing our system. During the meeting, Professor Erickson brought up an
                                                    important point about how water samples tend to be quite dilute so sample
                                                    processing would need to be done before we could test the samples using a
                                                    microfluidics chip. He also mentioned that when deciding on parts for our
                                                    system, we need to consider what kind of information we are trying to obtain
                                                    as well as whether there are any antibodies that are specific to what we
                                                    are trying to detect. Although we ultimately decided not to pursue the route
                                                    of microfluidics as the method of detection for our project, Professor Erickson’s
                                                    suggestions pointed us in the right direction, and we eventually decided
                                                    to use an RNA aptamer for detecting the presence of microcystins in our water
                                                    samples.

                                                <p class="text-justify">Our Policy & Practices team went down to the Ithaca Farmers
                                                    Market on Saturday, June 22nd, to gauge the interest of local vendors in
                                                    our project’s topic. One vendor we spoke to was Scott Van Gaasbeck, who runs
                                                    Under the Tree Stoneware &amp Leather Goods. We briefly chatted with Scott
                                                    before exchanging contact information so we could follow-up with more detailed
                                                    questions about his experiences with harmful algal blooms (HABs). During
                                                    our follow-up conversation, Scott confirmed that algal blooms can be seen
                                                    on lakes or ponds in the area during most summers, but it’s difficult to
                                                    distinguish between toxic and non-toxic blooms. He also mentioned that monitoring
                                                    the toxicity levels of algal blooms would be a good idea given the risks
                                                    they pose to human and animal health. When we brought up our team’s idea
                                                    to have a small- to medium-sized boat traversing local lakes to collect water
                                                    samples for detecting toxins, Scott expressed his support and suggested pairing
                                                    our device with satellite technology for locating algal blooms. Scott’s feedback
                                                    provided valuable insight into the thoughts and opinions of community stakeholders,
                                                    which allowed us to ensure that our project aligns with the needs of those

                                                    chair of the Planning, Energy and Environmental Quality committee. After
                                                    attending the monthly meeting of the committee in July, we reached out to
                                                    Mrs. Dawson to learn what initiatives they were pursuing to address HABs
                                                    in the Finger Lakes region, and more specifically, Cayuga Lake. Mrs. Dawson
                                                    explained to us how each Finger Lake had its own circumstances. Smaller lakes,
                                                    such as Owasco Lake, are mostly contained within one county, whereas larger
                                                    lakes are split between multiple counties. It’s easier to address HABs concerns
                                                    in smaller lakes due to the fact that only a single county has to devote
                                                    their resources to remediation and can prioritize their level of concern.
                                                    With larger lakes, such as Cayuga Lake, which is divided between three counties,
                                                    there must be an active collaboration initiative. This can be difficult to
                                                    coordinate, as each county may have different priorities and concerns for
                                                    lake health. However, Mrs. Dawson went on to reassure us that there were
                                                    several community members in these counties that were actively working to
                                                    address HABs. She was kind enough to introduce us and our project to these
                                                    individuals, putting us in contact with an extensive network of community
                                                    members committed to tackling the issue of HABs. These connections offered
                                                    us direction and additional resources to tailor our product for implementation
                                                    in the Cayuga Lake region.

                                                <h3>HABs Committee</h3>
                                                <p class="text-justify">One of the contacts introduced to us by Deborah Dawson
                                                    was Amanda Champion, District 12 Legislator on Tompkins County Board, who
                                                    invited us to sit in on a meeting with several advocates for HABs remediation.
                                                    Representatives from the Community Science Institute (CSI), other district
                                                    legislators, and several other organizations, such as the Water Treatment
                                                    Facility, were all present. During this meeting, we were able to engage in
                                                    a discussion with other concerned community members about what sort of initiatives
                                                    we should undertake to address the issue of HABs. Moreover, we were able
                                                    to have a conversation about how reHAB would fit into the existing infrastructure
                                                    that deals with HABs. CSI representatives offered us resources to help test
                                                    the accuracy of our water sampling. Additionally, several legislators were
                                                    interested in having us come present to a town board meeting to generate
                                                    more interest in our project.
