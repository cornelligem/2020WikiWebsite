            Tackling breast cancer is a monumental task. We began Lumicure cautiously,
            knowing that there are many risks, ethical concerns, and legal consequences of our
             project. To address these concerns, we researched potential side effects, the
             impact of our project beyond the science, and the legal background of cancer
             treatments. Through constant dialogue with cancer researchers, public health
             experts, and even everyday people, we gained valuable insight on the policies
             of Lumicure.

            Because synthetic biology is a relatively new technology, ethical concerns surrounding the misuse of science and who this technology will benefit inevitably arise. To better understand the impact of our project, we prioritized two ethical issues: risk transparency and cancer treatment disparities.
            <br><br>
            One of the main concerns is the introduction of genetically modified organisms, specifically E. coli. We should be able to prevent and account for potentially harmful biological material [1]. When introducing modified bacteria, we must consider how organisms will impact patients. When bringing this up Dr. Fischbach, we discussed historically successful cancer therapies, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of each. Specifically, when speaking with Dr. Brooks, we learned how chemotherapy is a powerful but invasive approach, and many patients are reluctant to receive this treatment due to potential side effects. Keeping these safety considerations in mind, we aim to be transparent with our project’s benefits and drawbacks. We also discuss more in our Safety and Risk Assessment.
            <br><br>
            An ethical issue arises when considering that certain populations receive better cancer treatment than others [2]. Area-level education has explained 31-39% of differences in breast cancer tumor size [3]. Our collaboration with Dr. Amelia Safi to address these disparities has propelled us to think more critically of our work beyond the lab. She pointed out that one of the leading causes of cancer treatment disparities is unequal education. From a young age, underprivileged students are stunted from reaching economic success, ultimately resulting in the vast treatment gap between communities of different upbringings. Since then, we participated in a 4H mentorship program for high school students and guided a student towards higher education in art and science.
            <br><br>
            Our project is committed to addressing our impact: through the patients that our therapeutic can treat and the mentorship that we can provide along the way.

            The United States has passed a variety of laws throughout history
            regarding cancer research and healthcare. The Triple-Negative Breast
            Cancer Research and Education Act of 2019 (H.R. 5939) increased funding
            for triple-negative breast cancer research. The Breast Cancer Research
            Stamp Reauthorization Act of 2015, P.L. 114-99 (S.1170/H.R. 2191)
            authorized the US Postal Service to issue a semipostal to raise funds.
           70% of these funds went towards breast cancer research at the National
            Institute of Health from these Breast Cancer Research Stamps. The Breast
           Cancer Patient Protection Act of 2003 amended the Public Health Service
           Act & Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The new requirements included individual and group health insurance coverage as well as a minimum 48 hour hospital stay for mastectomy patients. The Henrietta Lacks Enhancing Cancer Research Act of 2019 (H.R. 1966, S. 946) aims to hold federal agencies accountable for including underrepresented individuals in testing trials. Lumicure wants to ensure that all people who need our bacterial therapeutic have access to it. While this legislation does not directly affect Lumicure, it has impacted our process
            and will continue to do so as we consider future steps regarding funding
             and clinical trials.
            <br><br>
            We realize that with a breast cancer therapeutic we will be one day
             working with humans. To do so, we must examine the guidelines that
             the U.S. Public Health Service and Food and Drug Administration set.
              The FDA sets guidelines to regulate the approval of Microbial Vectors
               used for Gene Therapy (MVGTs). To approve our breast cancer therapy
              MVGT as an Investigational New Drug (IND), our next steps would be:
              <br>

            The main concern of our assessment is potential adverse effects on patients. The trichosanthin used in our drug therapy has been utilized in a few research studies, but has not been studied extensively in clinical trials, and due to the lack of research, it has not been approved by the FDA. Because of the lack of data available, we cannot be sure that all potential side-effects have been accounted for. To decrease the risks, a kill switch is contained within each plasmid in the bacteria that will destroy the therapeutic if it strays from the target area, or causes adverse effects. Another potential adverse effect is sepsis. In clinical trials for other bacteria therapeutics such as salmonella, the tolerated dose was tested. At high doses there were signs of dangerous inflammation, and with any infection there is the risk of sepsis. To counteract this risk, Lumicure will start out at a low dose and slowly increase in concentration during clinical trials. If signs of inflammation are shown, dose will immediately be lowered and antibiotics will be administered if necessary.
            <br><br>
            Another crucial part of our project is the fluorescent scanner. Introducing mCardinal into the body, we need to be sure that it will all dissolve or be expelled from the body after it has accomplished its tasks. Lingering and accumulating mCardinal over time could pose a threat to patients. mCardinal is water soluble, so accumulation over time will not be a problem. Regulating the amount of mCardinal within the body is another precaution taken to prevent potential risks. Another consideration with fluorescence is the possible risks of red light. Utilizing low-level light therapy, no harmful tumor growth has been found.
            <br><br>
            We recommend that Lumicure be taken in conjunction with other breast cancer therapies as it will not completely eradicate breast cancer. Similar to chemotherapy, Lumicure will not destroy all breast cancer tumors, but it will work to minimize the cancer.</p>

            <p class="standard-page-content-text">
              Before implementing the bacteria therapy in humans, it is important to meet all FDA regulations. The Quality Risk Management assesses the readiness of a medication or therapy for human use. The FDA published the Quality Risk Assessment to be used as guidance throughout the development process. It examines the risks associated with the product and ensures high product quality. The Quality Risk Assessment begins with identifying a risk. It moves on to analyze and evaluate the risk as shown on the FDA chart below. In the future, our team will conduct a Quality Risk Management Assessment on each concern regarding Lumicure.
