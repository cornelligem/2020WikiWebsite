            Engaging with the public and learning from the community is just as important as learning about a topic
            through scientific literature. Through engaging with various community leaders and organizations, we learned

            As part of the volunteer activity with YOURS, we prepared two experiments to spark the scientific interest
            of elementary school students. One was the classic Mentos and Coke experiment, and the other was making
            homemade ice cream. The children were very energetic and enthusiastic about the activities. For the Mentos
            experiment, they were eager to drop the Mentos into the Coke bottle to set off the reaction. During the
            ice-cream-making process, the children worked through each step on their own with some guidance from our
            team members. We explained why the experiments worked, such as how the outer surface of the Mentos caused
            the carbonated soda to explode out of the bottle. This experience allowed us to teach the students about
            some of the neat ways in which science works around us.

            Aptagen is a synthetic biology company that specializes in detection methods using aptamers. On April 11th,
            Cornell iGEM collaborated with the Biomedical Engineering Society to host Dr. G. Thomas Caltagirone,
            President and CEO of Aptagen, for a public seminar talk on the use of aptamers in cutting-edge technology.
            Aptamers are short DNA and RNA molecules that can selectively bind to small molecules such as peptides,
            proteins, biomarkers, cells, and tissues. Once an aptamer has bound to a target molecule, labels such as
            fluorescent tags, enzymes, or reporters allow for the detection of the target molecule. Some of the
            advantages of using aptamers over antibodies, which are used in ELISAs, include lower manufacturing costs
            and detection time. During his talk, Dr. Caltagirone introduced us to some of the defining technologies
            developed by Aptagen, such as the Aptabecon, a novel idea that eliminates the need for an assay to detect
            the fluorescence produced by an aptamer. We were pleased to be able to share this experience with other
            members of the Cornell community, and we learned a lot about the neat applications of aptamers in synthetic
            biology. Through this event, our team gained some additional inspiration for our 2019 project, which uses an
            RNA aptamer to detect the presence of microcystins in lakewater samples. </p>

            iGEM participated in the event by showcasing our past projects and preparing an interactive activity for

            was able to explain the various ways we connect with, learn from, and give back to the community through our

            Splash! is an annual event at Cornell University where middle school and high school students can sign up to
            attend different workshops taught by Cornell groups and organizations. This year, our team hosted a workshop
            to teach the students about synthetic biology. There were three stations: strawberry DNA extraction, gel
            electrophoresis, and bioethics. During the one-hour session, three groups of students would take turns at
            each station. Before starting, we would explain what synthetic biology is and how it differs from genetic
            engineering. The DNA extraction and gel electrophoresis stations provided opportunities for students to get
            hands-on experience extracting DNA from store-bought strawberries and learning to pipette small amounts of
            liquid using a micropipette. Each station included a mini-lecture to teach students about the science behind
            each activity. At the bioethics station, the three case studies we prepared addressed central issues in
            synthetic biology, and students had a chance to consider various directions of technological advancement and
            to debate amongst themselves. Splash! provided us with a great opportunity to connect with students and to
            share with them our passion for synthetic biology. </p>

            4-H Careers Exploration is an annual event hosted on Cornellâ€™s campus that provides middle school students
            with an opportunity to explore various fields and careers. Cornell iGEM participated in this event by
            hosting six University U sessions in late June. Together with the students, we explored the foundational
            concepts of DNA extraction, gel electrophoresis, and bioethics through three stations with hands-on
            activities and small-group discussions to encourage participation and dialogue.
            <br><br>
            At the DNA extraction station, each student was given a strawberry to pulverize for extracting its DNA. Our
            team members explained the purpose of each step of the process working towards the extraction of strawberry
            DNA, so the kids were able to understand why they were adding dish soap and isopropyl alcohol to the
            strawberry liquid. From this point, we drew parallels between the protocols used in wet lab work to the
            extraction they just accomplished with everyday household materials.

            Our team traveled to the New York State Fair at Syracuse on September 2nd to host an educational booth as
            part of the 4H organization. We designed fun activities to inspire children about the possibilities of
            genetic engineering. We prepared an educational kit where kids could design cells to make synthetic blood or
            even cure cancer. Many children who came were genuinely interested in science but lacked information about
            synthetic biology. By allowing the kids to design their own cells, they became the scientists while we were
            merely the helpers. Many children showed great interest in the designing process and expressed intrigue in
            becoming a scientist and actually designing the cells in the lab. Through this experience, we were able to
            introduce synthetic biology and spark curiosity about science.

            On September 26th, Cornell iGEM was invited to host a discussion about synthetic biology in an event
            organized by Cornell Alliance for Science, which is an organization interested in promoting scientific
            innovation for food security and environmental sustainability. We started by briefly introducing our team
            and our past projects on synthetic biology. Although the majority of the members were not familiar with
            synthetic biology, they were deeply interested in the definition of synthetic biology and its difference
            from genetic engineering. Many of them shared their opinion on the development of synthetic biology and the
            ethical concerns they have about manipulating biological systems.
            <br><br>
            Afterwards, we introduced three case scenarios to them. The scenarios were hypothetical situations that
            explored the impact of advances in synthetic biology on various aspects of society. The group discussed how
            we should cope with these issues in real life instead of trying to decide who is right or wrong. Some group
            members were legal experts, and they shared their assessment of conflicting situations based on current
            legislation. One of the case scenarios dealt with the property dispute over genetically modified crops
            between the farmers and companies that developed the crops. Many individuals brought up the current
            legislation on GMOs and discussed the importance of assigning ownership in the contract.
            <br><br>
            Overall, the members of Alliance for Science were interested in learning about the potential of synthetic
            biology and wanted to know more about our projects. Through the discussion with Cornell Alliance for
            Science, our team was able to connect with people interested in synthetic biology and encourage them to
            consider the bioethics of applying the technology to society.

            To engage with the general public through social media, we decided to publish weekly Member Spotlights to
            highlight the diversity within our members in both their professional and personal interests. Despite
            ranging in majors from Biological Sciences to Computer Science, we were all tied together by our shared
            interest in synthetic biology and its applications. In addition to promoting our members, the Member
            Spotlights were used to publicize a variety of events that our group hosted, such as the Aptagen Seminar
            Talk, and to recap events, such as the 4-H Careers Exploration event, to share our multi-faceted approach to
            connecting with the community.

            We have been working on a knowledge collaboration with two highschool students, Darlsy and Kim. Darlsy
            wanted to make a booklet that can be distributed in Africa to spread awareness of biotechnology. We have
            helped her collect sources for the booklet, and currently are helping her design the layout of the booklet.
            Kim is working on a project to extract AB15, the gene responsible for producing abscisic acid, a plant
            hormone responsible for allowing increased stomatal conductivity in extreme survival conditions. Her project
            involves genetically engineering crops with the AB15 gene to become drought tolerant, and we have been
            helping her with the DNA extraction process. Because she was unfamiliar with the process of isolating DNA,
            we tried to explain wet lab techniques used in DNA extraction. We introduced CRISPR-Cas9 and homologous
            recombination. Due to limited access to the restriction enzymes used in CRISPR, we recommended that she use
            homologous recombination instead. Kim is currently working on the DNA isolation process, and we are
            consulted whenever she encounters technical problems. Through the two collaborations, we have provided
            resources and practical guidance for students working on projects in synthetic biology.
